I'm Lucas Ingles Zarpellon and it's pleasure to meet you! 👋


I’m a data specialist from Paraná, Brazil, passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights.<br><br>

Currently working for one of the biggest private  held companies in the world, where I contribute to the global Supply Chain Excellence team, optimizing processes and driving strategic decisions.
<br><br>

I’m constantly exploring AI and innovative analytics, currently enhancing my skills through MIT’s MicroMasters Program in Statistics and Data Science. Whether it’s advanced analytics, machine learning, or statistics, I’m always eager to unlock the full potential of data.
<br><br>
When not immersed in data, I’m hiking through Brazil’s beautiful landscapes. 🥾🚶‍♂️
